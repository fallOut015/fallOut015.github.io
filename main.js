// sandwich cookie
// other pillsbury cookies
// sans cookie (people wanted these, for some reason)
// something that looks like a cookie
// chewy cookie (chips ahoy, to each their own)
// something keebler
// cosmic brownies (sure, these aren't cookies, but they're too good to not include)
// little debbie
// ding dongs (wait a minute, these aren't cookies! blech!)
// twinkies (also not cookies, you're not sure why people buy these. they're kind of gross)
// ice cream sandwich (these are the stuff, too bad a single bite will probably kill you)
// b-side cookies (it turns out you get an entirely new cookie just by turning one around! too bad you didn't think of this earlier on. you could have double the cursors! or double the grandmas!
// deja vu cookies (you feel like you've seen these before. are you sure they're new?)
// pop-tarts (why are these here? i mean, they're a good grab-n-go snack, butâ€•whatever)
